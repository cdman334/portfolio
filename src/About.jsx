            Hello! I'm <strong>Cody</strong>, a passionate technologist
            with a diverse skill set in programming and web development. With a
            keen interest in solving complex problems and turning data into
            insightful visuals, I've honed my expertise in the following areas:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Python Development</strong>: Over the years, I've
              developed a solid foundation in Python, particularly in the realms
              of data analytics and visualization. My ability to harness the
              power of data has enabled me to unearth patterns, trends, and
              insights that drive decision-making.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Database Management</strong>: I possess adept skills in
              SQL, allowing me to efficiently query, manage, and organize data
              in relational databases. My proficiency ensures that data is not
              just stored but is also retrieved and manipulated to serve
              meaningful purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web Development</strong>: I am well-versed in modern web
              technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My experience
              extends to React, which I've used to build dynamic and interactive
              user interfaces. The websites I develop are not just functional;
              they offer intuitive user experiences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Diverse Programming Knowledge</strong>: My curiosity
              doesn't stop at the aforementioned technologies. I'm familiar with
              a range of programming languages, including Java, C#, and R,
              broadening my problem-solving toolkit.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I believe in continuous learning and strive to stay updated with the
            latest in technology. Whether it's creating powerful data
            visualizations or developing responsive web applications, my goal
            remains the same: to create impactful solutions that resonate with
            users.
